## Model Implementation

### Import libraries

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(sensitivity)
library(tidyverse)
library(deSolve)
library(here)
```

### Prepare function

```{r}
# Import function
source(here("R","lotvmodH.R"))

# Add paramters
pars <- c(rprey = 0.95, alpha = 0.01, eff = 0.6, pmort = 0.4, k = 2000)

# stability = when predator and prey derivitives equal zero
```

## Model Exploration

### different hunting rates

```{r}

```

### different minimum prey populations

```{r}
# Look at different minimum prey populations (before hunting is allowed) --> how does it effect stability of both populations?


```
